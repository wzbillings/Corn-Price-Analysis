# Raw data downloading script
# Zane Billings
# This script downloads the current version of the USDA feed grains database.
#  Unfortunately the USDA changes this link for every version of the database
#  and it is AFAIK impossible to automate without scraping the webpage which
#  seems like an awful lot of trouble.
# So if you want to update the data you need to check
#  https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/feed-grains-yearbook-tables.aspx
#  to get the updated link.
